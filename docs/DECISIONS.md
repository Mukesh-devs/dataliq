# Design decisions

Deviations from, or clarifications of, `BUILD_PLAN.md`, with the reasoning.

## D1 — Repository root is the project root

The plan shows a `bigview/` folder. This repository *is* the project, so
`src-tauri/`, `src/`, `scripts/` etc. live at the repo root. A Cargo workspace
at the root lets `cargo fmt/clippy/test` run from the root as the check script
expects.

## D2 — Dependency versions

Pinned to the newest stable releases that were at least two weeks old when the
project started (2026-10-26), with these exceptions:

- **React 18.3.1, not 19.** The data grid (`@glideapps/glide-data-grid` 6.0.3,
  its latest stable) declares React `16–18` as its peer range. Only an alpha
  supports React 19. The grid is the core of the app, so we stay on React 18
  until a stable grid release supports 19.
- **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7.** `typescript-eslint` 8.71 supports TypeScript
  `< 6.1`. TypeScript 7 (the native port) is not yet supported by the lint stack.

## D3 — License: MIT

The plan allows Apache-2.0 or MIT. MIT is the shortest and the most common in
the Tauri ecosystem.

## D4 — Optimized dependencies in debug builds

`[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 2` in the root `Cargo.toml`. DuckDB is
compiled from bundled C++ and is far too slow unoptimized; this keeps
`cargo test` and `tauri build --debug` usable without changing our own crate's
debug experience.
