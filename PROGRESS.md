# Progress

Tracks each step of [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md): what was done, how it was
tested, and anything left over.

## v0.1 — Core viewer

### Step 1 — Scaffold ✅

- Tauri v2 (2.12) + React 18 + TypeScript 6 (strict) + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4.
- Cargo workspace at the repo root with the app crate in `src-tauri/`.
- `scripts/check.sh` / `scripts/check.ps1`, `scripts/smoke.sh` (Linux screenshot smoke check).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): checks + `tauri build --debug` on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows.
- Docs: README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE (MIT), docs/ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, BENCHMARKS.
- Tested: Vitest render test; `scripts/check.sh` passes locally (Linux); smoke check —
  the debug binary opens a 1280×800 window showing "BigView" (Xvfb screenshot).
- Left over: none.

### Step 2 — Design system and app shell ✅

- Design tokens as CSS variables (`src/styles/tokens.css`) mapped to Tailwind utilities;
  light and dark themes, following the OS by default; compact/comfortable density.
- Inter + JetBrains Mono bundled from `@fontsource-variable` (no CDN).
- Layout: tab bar (+ open button, search / Ctrl+K box), sidebar (Files, Columns),
  main area, status bar with theme toggle. Empty state: drop zone + recent files.
- Tested: Vitest render tests (layout regions, empty state, theme switching, density,
  shortcut formatting, settings store); Playwright screenshots of both themes plus a
  theme-persistence flow. Smoke check: the debug app window shows the shell with the
  bundled fonts under the strict CSP.
- Left over: drag-and-drop and Open are wired up in step 10 (Tabs and opening).
